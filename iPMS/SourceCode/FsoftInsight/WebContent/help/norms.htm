<p class="TITLE">Norms</p>
<p>Norms are the organization standard values for various metrics.<br>
The metrics meaning can be found at :<br>
<a href="../../../../../fsoft-filesrv/Fsoft-QMS/Document/Fsoft/Software/Guideline/Guideline_Software%20metrics%20.doc">

metrics .doc</a></p>
<p>Norms are made of three values:<br>
LCL: Lower Control Limit.<br>
UCL: Upper Control Limit<br>
Norm: The value of the norm</p>
<p>A metric is considered <i>in-control </i>when it's actual value is between
LCL and UCL. When the value of the metric is out of these boundaries, it should
be paid special attention to analyze and eventually take action to bring the
value back&nbsp; <i>in-control.<br>
</i>The <i>Norm </i>value is the target between LCL and UCL.</p>
<p>Distribution metrics: These special norms don't have LCL and UCL.</p>
<p>Norms are defined for a period of six month. Projects will be assigned a set
of norms depending on which set of norm is defined for their lifecycle at the
time of their <i>Actual start date.</i></p>

<p>When a norm is not yet set, the suggested value (from the previous period)
will appear in red. In order to apply these values, please save the norms</p>
