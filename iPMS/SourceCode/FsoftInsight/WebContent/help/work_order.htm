<p class="TITLE">Work Order</p>
<p>&nbsp;The work order (WO) can be accessed by clicking on the <i>project </i>tab
after login, selecting a project in the list (in case you have rights on several
projects), and choosing a sub-menu from the <i>Work order </i>icon in the left
pane.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The WO in the application has been built upon the WO template of FSOFT.
For browsing convenience, the WO is split into several sub-pages, you can
navigate between sub-pages by clicking on the sub-menus that appear when the
mouse pointer is over the WO menu.</p>
<p>Most information is presented
in lists, in order to view the details of a row you can click on the leftmost
column of the row. You will then be able to update or delete the item selected.
In case you want to add a new item, there will be, each time, if it is possible
and if you have manage rights on the work order, a button <i>Add new </i>on the
bottom of each list.</p>
<p>However, in some cases described below, the application is less intuitive :</p>
<p>- <a href="woDeliverables.htm" target="_self">Why can't I add a new deliverable ? Why isn't there any deliverables ?</a></p>
<p>- I don't understand the <a href="signatures_pages.htm" target="_self">Signature page</a>
!</p>
