<p class="TITLE">Defects</p>

<p class="TableCaption"><a name="Defect page">Defects information page</a></p>
<p>The header of defect page display information about <i>actual</i> defects
metrics.</p>

<p>On the rest of the page are displayed two charts <i>Defect Deviation Tracking</i> and <i>Product Defect Deviation Tracking</i> with data you planned in PPM Defect</p>

<p>Project started before <b>15-Oct-2005</b> will use <b>old defect planning</b> described below, after that it will use <b>PPM Defect</b>.</p>

<p>On the rest of the page are displayed planned and actual data for <i>Weighted
review/test defects by process. </i>The planning information can be updated (<i>button
update </i>) provided that you have update rights.</p>
<p>Note 1 about the <i>defect rate </i>formula:<br>
If there is at least one <i>product</i> &nbsp;of <i>workproduct</i> “software
package” released before the date considered and the actual project size is 1
UCP at least,&nbsp; the formula will be:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total number of weighed defects/actual project size<span lang="FR"><br>
If not&nbsp;:<br>
</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total number of weighed defects/planned (or re-planned
id defined) project size</p>
<p>Note 2: The values for <i>planned</i> and <i>re-planned defects</i> for the
project are calculated based on the information of <i>Weighted review/test
defects by process.</i></p>
<p class="TableCaption">Detail <a name="Planned defects listing">planned defects
listing</a></p>
<p>This screen lets you plan in detail, by process, weighted defects planned to
be found.<br>
Defects can be planned for <i>Work products </i>or for <i>
<a href="modules_and_size.htm">products</a>.</i><br>
For a more convenient use, the organization of this screen is rather different
than the rest of the application:</p>
<p>-To add/update defect planning data please select EITHER a <i>work product</i>
OR a <i>product </i>in one of the corresponding combo box.<br>
If you choose a <i>work product</i> then you will plan defect for <i>work
product</i>, if you choose a <i>product </i>&nbsp;then you will plan defect for
<i>product.</i> <br>
If defects are already planned for the <i>work product/module </i>selected, then
the existing data will appear in text boxes for update.<br>
The numbers displayed between parentheses are the maximum values for the fields.
The maximum values for <i>work product </i>come from the planned/re-planned
defects in the <a href="#Defect page">defect page</a> (see above). The maximum
values for <i>products</i> come from the values planned for the parent <i>work
product.</i></p>
<p>-to delete defect planning data simply click on the 'D' (for delete) in the
leftmost column.</p>
<p class="TableCaption">Defect progress chart</p>
<p>This chart helps monitor the fixed versus found defects status, the more the
space between the lines is big, the more defects need to be fixed.</p>
<p class="TableCaption"><a name="DPlog">Defect prevention log (DP log)</a></p>
<p>Track in this section all the activities planned to be carried in order to
prevent common defects from occuring</p>
<p class="TableCaption">Common defects</p>
<p>List in this section the common defects likely to occur in the the project.
It is recommended that Defect prevention activities (see above) are created to
mitigate each common defect. The mapping between the common defects and the DP
Log can be tracked using&nbsp; the DP Code column.</p>
<p class="TableCaption"><a name="ppm defect">PPM Defect</a></p>
<p>The models are used for project managers to forecast and plan project defects.</p>
<p>Any tailoring/deviation of the models has to be approved by the Head of SEPG.</p>
<p>These models have been developed for the full life cycle development project based on linear forecasting model.</p>
<p>There are two models: Stage Defect Planning and Product Defect Planning.</p>
<p class="TableCaption">Stage Defect Planning</p>
<p>Defect Distribution and Defect Removal Efficiency are planned using Fsoft norms based on lastest Fsoft PCB and Fsoft business objectives that is available at the planning time</p>
<p>Defect Distribution and Defect Removal Efficiency are constant in project progress</p>
<p>Committed Leakage is constant in project progress. Interim objectives are Planned Defect found after each stage</p>
<p>QC productivity (Review effectiveness, test effectiveness) is constant</p>
<p>Replanned Defect Rate = Previous planned defect rate * (1+ Average project defect found deviation)</p>
<p>For maintenance projects: Change the name of stages as appropriately. Change the Norm values.</p>
<p>Plan defect with following steps:</p>
<p>- Plan Defect Removal Efficiency by QC Activities by Stages. After you planned, you click <i>Plan Defect</i> to view defect plan by stage.</p>
<p>- Replan after each stage, please note that this time you plan by WD, not by Defect Removal Efficiency.</p>
<p>- Defect rate and Leakage pages will help you to track Defect rate and Possible Leakage for each stage.</p>

<p class="TableCaption">Product Defect Planning</p>
<p>Defect Rate and Defect Removal Efficiency are planned using the Fsoft norms based on lastest Fsoft PCB and Fsoft business objectives that is available at the planning time</p>
<p>Defect Removal Efficiency are constant for a product in project progress</p>
<p>Committed Leakage is constant for a product in project progress. Interim objectives are Defect found Deviation after each product release</p>
<p>QC productivity is constant</p>
<p>Replanned Defect Rate = Previous planned defect rate * (1+ Average defect found deviation)</p>
<p>Apply the model at least for all deriverables in projects</p>
<p>Plan defect for products with following steps:</p>
<p>- Plan defect for products by QC activities.</p>
<p>- After project release at least one product in the plan, replan defect for other product.</p>
<p>- Defect rate will help you to track Defect rate for each product in the plan.</p>
