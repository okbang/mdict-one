<p class="TITLE">Signatures pages</p>

<p>The signatures pages (one in <i>Work order</i> section, one in <i>Project
Plan</i> section), provide a convenient way to gather online the agreement of
the project contractors/parties. It is not about real signatures, but their
virtual equivalent i.e. the proof that the party agreed to the contract.</p>
<p>Prerequisite is that all parties have a account on the application, and the <i>view
right </i>or<i> manage right </i>on the <i>Work order</i> or <i>Project Plan</i>
section involved . If not the case please refer to <a href="user_profiles.htm#Creating a User Profile" target="_self">Creating a user profile</a>
section.</p>
<p>First we need to define whose <i>signature</i> (or online agreement) are
needed, for this we must login the application with <i>manage rights </i>on <i>Work
order</i> section or <i>Project Plan</i> section (depending on which you need
the <i>signatures</i> ) and go to sub-page <i>Signatures </i>of these sections<i>.</i></p>
<p>The signatures can be gathered for several sub-pages of the <i>Work order</i>
or <i>Project Plan,</i> this is why you will see several lists with the
corresponding topic on top of each.</p>
<p>Choose the topic you need the signature for, on the bottom of the
corresponding list you see 2 buttons : <i>Delete </i>and <i>Add New.<br>
</i></p>
<p class="TableCaption"><a name="Adding a signature">Adding a signature</a></p>
<p>On the right hand of the <i>Add New </i>button, there is a combo box with the
list of the application users. Select the one you need the <i>signature</i> for,
and click on <i>Add New </i>button. The page will be refreshed and the user
selected will appear in the list.</p>
<p class="TableCaption"><a name="Deleting a signature">Deleting a signature</a></p>
<p>Select one or more users in the list by clicking in the check boxes and
delete their <i>signature</i> by clicking on delete. This action will not change
anything in the user account, it will just remove him from the signatures list
(you can re-add the user anytime by <a href="#Adding a signature" target="_self">Adding a signature</a>).</p>
<p class="TableCaption"><a name="Signing">Signing</a></p>
<p>In order to give their approval to the <i>Work order</i> or <i>Project Plan,</i>
the users whose signature have been <a href="#Adding a signature" target="_self">added to the signature list</a> can open
the corresponding signature page and click on the button <i>Approve.</i> The
application will track the approval date and status.</p>
