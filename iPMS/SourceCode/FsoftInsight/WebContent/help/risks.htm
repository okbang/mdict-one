<p>There are several types of risks, depending on the type you will have to
input some fields but not some others.</p>

<p>When adding a risk you will be prompted to select an existing risk (these
common risks have been baselined from the <a href="process_assets.htm">process
assets page</a>). If one of the common risks suits you, you can select it by
clicking the corresponding radio button then pressing &quot;add existing risk &quot;
button, otherwise, new risks blank can be created by pressing &quot;add new risk&quot;
button</p>

<p>When adding/updating a risk, it is advised to answer the following questions
before filling in any data.</p>

<p>- <u>Is your risk occured or not ?</u> If the risk is occured you must select
<i>status </i>&quot;occured&quot; and the fields of actual effects will appear.</p>

<p>- <u>If your risk occured, was it planned or not ?</u> After select <i>status
</i>&quot;occured&quot;, if risk wasn't planned then check the <i>unplanned</i> check box.
You won't have to fill any of the planning information.</p>
