<p>The deliverables are products that needs to be given to the customer. Right
after the creation of any project, we must first define and estimate the size of
the products before specifying that some of them are deliverables.</p>

to <a href="modules_and_size.htm#Creating a product" target="_blank">Creating a product</a></p>
<p>Once that one or more products are created (and that one or more <i>products</i>
are not defined as <i>deliverable</i>), and if you have the manage right on the <i>Work
order </i>the <i>Add new </i>button will be available in the <i>Deliverables</i>
page.</p>

<p>Click on the button <i>Add new </i>on the bottom of the deliverable list, a
new page will appear and let us input the following information :</p>
<p>- <i>Deliverable </i>: You can choose among the list of products that are not <i>deliverable
</i>yet, the one that you want to define as deliverable.</p>
