<p class="TITLE">Roles</p>
<p>Roles are entities that define the access rights for sections of the
application.<br>
Roles names can be for example : administrator, group leader, programmer,
project leader, tester ...<br>
Roles only apply after they are associated with a Work unit in the <a href="user_profiles.htm#Granting rights to a user" target="_self">User
profile section</a>.</p>
<p class="TableCaption"><a name="Creating a role">Creating a role</a></p>
<p>The easiest way to understand the role concept is to take an example, let's
say that the customer of project x wants to have access to the project x data,
we need to create a role called &quot;customer&quot;.</p>
<p>First we will login the application using an account with administrator
rights, then we will click on the <i>Admin </i>tab, and click on&nbsp; <i>Roles</i>
icon in
the left menu. A page will appear with the current list of <i>Roles</i> defined.
On the bottom of the list, please click on <i>Add New</i> button. A new page
will appear where we will define the new Role :</p>
<p>- <i>Role name</i>: Input here the chosen role name, in our example &quot;Customer&quot;.
Note: this name must be unique in the role list</p>
<p>- <i>Description </i>: Input here some short description of your choice</p>
<p>- <i>Dashboard
      Role</i>: This field is used by Dashboard application, if Dashboard is required, please&nbsp;
refer to Dashboard documentation, otherwise, the value doesn't matter.</p>
<p>- Below the previous fields, there is a list of items divided in 2 columns,
in the right columns are listed the application sections' names&nbsp; (or <i>Pages</i>),
the left column is the right that will be granted to the Customer on these
sections. There are 3 types of rights :</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <i>No right</i> (column 1) means that the Customer will
not be able to view the contents of the section</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <i> View only right</i> (column 2) means that the
Customer will be able to view the contents of the section, but will not be
allowed to change the data of this section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * <i> Manager right</i> (column 3) means that the Customer
will be able to view the contents of the section and allowed to change the data
of this section.</p>
<p>In our example, the Customer doesn't need to change any data, and just needs
to view the data of his project X. So, we will grant the Customer <i>role&nbsp; </i>the<i>
View only right</i> on all <i>project</i> related sections (all sub-sections
under the section <i>Project home</i>), we will check <i>No right </i>on all
other sections. </p>

<p>- Click <i>Ok </i>button in order to validate the Customer <i>Role</i>
creation. </p>

<p>- If we want to finish the example, the next steps are : <a href="user_profiles.htm#Creating a User Profile" target="_self">Create User
profile</a> for the Customer and then <a href="user_profiles.htm#Granting rights to a user" target="_self">grant him rights
</a>. </p>
