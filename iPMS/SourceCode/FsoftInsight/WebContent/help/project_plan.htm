<p class="TITLE">Project plan </p>
<p>&nbsp;The Project plan (PP) can be accessed by clicking on the <i>project </i>tab
after login, selecting a project in the list (in case you have rights on several
projects), and clicking on the <i>Project plan </i>icon in the left menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The PP in the application has been built upon the PP template of FSOFT.
For browsing convenience, the PP is split into several sub-pages, you can
navigate between sub-pages by using the buttons that appear in the bottom frame
of all PP pages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In most cases the information that you can manipulate has the same
structure as it had in the PP template of FSOFT. Most information is presented
in lists, in order to view the details of a row you can click on the leftmost
column of the row. You will then be able to update or delete the item selected.
In case you want to add a new item, there will be, each time, if it is possible
and if you have manage rights on the <i>project plan</i>, a button <i>Add new </i>on
the bottom of each list.</p>
<p>However, in some cases described below, the application is less intuitive :</p>
<p>- <a href="modules_and_size.htm" target="_self">Why can't I add a review and test activity
</a> ?</p>
<p>- <a target="_self" href="signatuesPP.htm">I don't understand the Signature page.</a></p>
